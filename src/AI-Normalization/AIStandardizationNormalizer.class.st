I can normalize the numeric collection by scaling all numbers to be centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. I do not modify the existing collection but create a new one.

Given a numeric collection $ x = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n} $, I returned a normalized collection $ x' = \\{x_i'\\}_{i=1}^{n} $ in which each element is defined as

$ x_i' = \\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma} $

Where $ \\mu $ is a mean value of collection $ x $ and $ \\sigma $ is a standard deviation of $ x $.
